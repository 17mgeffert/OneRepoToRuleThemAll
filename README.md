# The One Repo

> Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky,
> Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone,
> Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die,
> One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne
> In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.
> One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,
> One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them
> In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.

## setup
* `npm install`
* `npm start`
* build dist `npm run build`
* run lint `npm run lint`

## Dockering
Docker compose will run locally with the overrides file to make things happy, the compose file by it's self *will* eventually run the prod swarm deploy.

```
docker-compose up
```
